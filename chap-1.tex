%Please don't abuse enumerations: short enumerations shouldn't use
%``\verb|itemize|'' or ``\texttt{enumerate}'' environments.
%So \emph{never write}: 
%\begin{quote}
%	The Eiffel tower has three floors:
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item the first one;
%		\item the second one;
%		\item the third one.
%	\end{itemize}
%\end{quote}
%But write:
%\begin{quote}
%	The Eiffel tower has three floors: the first one, the second one, and the
%	third one.
%\end{quote}
