\chapter{Basic data analysis}
\label{cha:1}
In this chapter details of the dataset are introduced and a basic analysis is performed. This includes assessing missing data, seasonality,  influence of temperature and household data, comparing weekdays and weekends, applying an ARIMA model for forecasting.

% Look at the comments during the meeting 'writing the WTK thesis'.
% Make sure that write every part sufficient substantiated.

\section{Introduction to dataset}
% how the dataset is made up --> use the information of the competition.
The data that is used in this thesis is made available for the \href{https://ieee-dataport.org/competitions/ieee-cis-technical-challenge-energy-prediction-smart-meter-data}{IEEE-CIS technical challenge on energy prediction from smart data}. It consists out of data from smart meters about the 1/2 hour granulated electricity consumption of $3248$ households located in the United Kingdom in the year $2017$. Each smart meter collected thus a total of $17520$ measurements. Not all the $3248$ smart meters consist of full data as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:amountNaN} in appendix \ref{app:A}. It can be clearly seen that there are $12$ steps in the amount of missing values. This is because the available data ranges from one month (only December) to a full year of data. This acknowledges that customers may have joined at different times during the year. Additionally, missing values are introduced due to errors in sending/receiving from smart meters.\\
Next to the electricity consumption of the different households, also information is available about the average, minimum and maximum temperature of the day on the location of the smart meter. This data is available at a daily resolution. Also, through voluntary surveys, incomplete information is collected about a number of smart meters. This concerns e.g. dwelling type, number of occupants, number of bedrooms etc. Table \ref{tab:attributes} displays all the attributes in appendix \ref{app:A}.\\





\section{Missing data}
First comes the introduction to this topic.

\section{Seasonality}


\section{Influence of temperature}


\section{Influence of household data}


\section{Comparing weekdays with weekends}

\section{Impact of holidays}


\section{ARIMA}


\section{Conclusion}
The final section of the chapter gives an overview of the important results
of this chapter. This implies that the introductory chapter and the
concluding chapter don't need a conclusion.




%Please don't abuse enumerations: short enumerations shouldn't use
%``\verb|itemize|'' or ``\texttt{enumerate}'' environments.
%So \emph{never write}: 
%\begin{quote}
%	The Eiffel tower has three floors:
%	\begin{itemize}
%		\item the first one;
%		\item the second one;
%		\item the third one.
%	\end{itemize}
%\end{quote}
%But write:
%\begin{quote}
%	The Eiffel tower has three floors: the first one, the second one, and the
%	third one.
