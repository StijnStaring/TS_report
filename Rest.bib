abstract = {Our goal is to accurately and efficiently learn reward functions for autonomous robots. Current approaches to this problem include inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), which uses expert demonstrations, and preference-based learning, which iteratively queries the user for her preferences between trajectories. In robotics however, IRL often struggles because it is difficult to get high-quality demonstrations; conversely, preference-based learning is very inefficient since it attempts to learn a continuous, high-dimensional function from binary feedback. We propose a new framework for reward learning, DemPref, that uses both demonstrations and preference queries to learn a reward function. Specifically, we (1) use the demonstrations to learn a coarse prior over the space of reward functions, to reduce the effective size of the space from which queries are generated; and (2) use the demonstrations to ground the (active) query generation process, to improve the quality of the generated queries. Our method alleviates the efficiency issues faced by standard preference-based learning methods and does not exclusively depend on (possibly low-quality) demonstrations. In numerical experiments, we find that DemPref is significantly more efficient than a standard active preference-based learning method. In a user study, we compare our method to a standard IRL method; we find that users rated the robot trained with DemPref as being more successful at learning their desired behavior, and preferred to use the DemPref system (over IRL) to train the robot.},

abstract = {To investigate the effect of velocity, acceleration, and gradient of acceleration on self-motion perception, thresholds for detection of direction of whole-body interaural acceleration were determined for various stimulus profiles. For acceleration steps, acceleration thresholds at 67{\%} correct detection of motion direction were similar for eight normals (mean 4.84 cm/s2 (range 2.9-6.3), peak gradient = 22 cm/s2) and five labyrinthine- defective subjects (mean 5.65 cm/s2 (4.85-6.6), peak gradient = 25 cm/s2). Velocity thresholds were 7.93 cm/s for a proportion of correct responses of 73{\%} for normals and 9.67 cm/s for 69{\%} of correct detection for avestibular subjects. For linear and parabolic accelerations, high intersubject variability was observed both among nine normals and three labyrinthine- defective subjects. Mean normal and avestibular subjects' acceleration thresholds for 74{\%} of correct responses were respectively 12.1 cm/s2 (7.3- 20.4) and 16.4 cm/s2 (13.2-20) for a ramp with gradient of acceleration = 2.8 cm/s2, 19.2 cm/s2 (10.4-35.3) and 28.2 cm/s2 (21.4-32.8) for a ramp with gradient = 7.9 cm/s3 and 16.7 cm/s2 (10.5-25) and 20.6 cm/s2 (18.424.2) for a parabola with second derivative = 1.52 cm/s4. The corresponding velocity thresholds for normals were 21.2 cm/s (5.2-50.3), 22.0 cm/s (7-56.6), and 22.2 cm/s (9.5-43.7). The lowest thresholds were obtained for acceleration steps indicating that a high acceleration gradient facilitates motion perception. For linear and parabolic accelerations, motion perception seemed to follow an integration of acceleration, but a high intersubject variability was observed. For all stimuli, the range of thresholds for normals and avestibular subjects overlapped showing that detection of motion was not a sole prerogative of the otoliths but could also be performed using somatosensory cues.},

abstract = {As the power system is facing a transition toward a more intelligent, flexible, and interactive system with higher penetration of renewable energy generation, load forecasting, especially short-term load forecasting for individual electric customers plays an increasingly essential role in the future grid planning and operation. Other than aggregated residential load in a large scale, forecasting an electric load of a single energy user is fairly challenging due to the high volatility and uncertainty involved. In this paper, we propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network-based framework, which is the latest and one of the most popular techniques of deep learning, to tackle this tricky issue. The proposed framework is tested on a publicly available set of real residential smart meter data, of which the performance is comprehensively compared to various benchmarks including the state-of-the-arts in the field of load forecasting. As a result, the proposed LSTM approach outperforms the other listed rival algorithms in the task of short-term load forecasting for individual residential households.},

abstract = {The rapid increase in human population and development in technology have sharply raised power consumption in today's world. Since electricity is consumed simultaneously as it is generated at the power plant, it is important to accurately predict the energy consumption in advance for stable power supply. In this paper, we propose a CNN-LSTM neural network that can extract spatial and temporal features to effectively predict the housing energy consumption. Experiments have shown that the CNN-LSTM neural network, which combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), can extract complex features of energy consumption. The CNN layer can extract the features between several variables affecting energy consumption, and the LSTM layer is appropriate for modeling temporal information of irregular trends in time series components. The proposed CNN-LSTM method achieves almost perfect prediction performance for electric energy consumption that was previously difficult to predict. Also, it records the smallest value of root mean square error compared to the conventional forecasting methods for the dataset on individual household power consumption. The empirical analysis of the variables confirms what affects to forecast the power consumption most.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel control framework to handle safety-critical control for non-affine nonlinear systems. The proposed control development is considered to deal l with safety-critical aspects in autonomous vehicle driving. The safety constraints are guaranteed using control barrier function (CBF), which implies forward-invariance of a safe set. In particular, we focus on CBF that enforces strict statedependent high relative degree constraints for general nonlinear vehicle models. Moreover, the CBF safety constraints are incorporated into a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework. The advantage is twofold. Firstly, both vehicle driving safety and comfort performance can be improved. Secondly, it helps to reduce computational burden in real time MPC implementation. The proposed algorithm is validated and compared with conventional NMPC in several safetycritical scenarios including sudden objects and road boundaries avoidance, showing improvements in both safety and smooth driving. The validation is conducted based on a co-simulation of two softwares, Siemens Simcenter Amesim and Prescan, which simulate high fidelity vehicle dynamics and traffic environment, respectively},

abstract = {The key challenge for household load forecasting lies in the high volatility and uncertainty of load profiles. Traditional methods tend to avoid such uncertainty by load aggregation (to offset uncertainties), customer classification (to cluster uncertainties) and spectral analysis (to filter out uncertainties). This paper, for the first time, aims to directly learn the uncertainty by applying a new breed of machine learning algorithms-deep learning. However, simply adding layers in neural networks will cap the forecasting performance due to the occurrence of over-fitting. A novel pooling-based deep recurrent neural network is proposed in this paper which batches a group of customers' load profiles into a pool of inputs. Essentially the model could address the over-fitting issue by increasing data diversity and volume. This paper reports the first attempts to develop a bespoke deep learning application for household load forecasting and achieved preliminary success. The developed method is implemented on Tensorflow deep learning platform and tested on 920 smart metered customers from Ireland. Compared with the state-of-The-Art techniques in household load forecasting, the proposed method outperforms ARIMA by 19.5{\%}, SVR by 13.1{\%} and classical deep RNN by 6.5{\%} in terms of RMSE.},

Sophisticated Bayesian optimization methods have recently achieved considerable successes in optimizing these hyperparameters, in several cases surpassing the performance of human experts. However, blind reliance on such methods can leave end users without insight into the relative importance of different hyperparameters and their interactions. This paper describes efficient methods that can be used to gain such insight, leveraging random forest models fit on the data already gathered by Bayesian optimization. We first introduce a novel, linear-time algorithm for computing marginals of random forest predictions and then show how to leverage these predictions within a functional ANOVA framework, to quantify the importance of both single hyperparameters and of interactions between hyperparameters. We conducted experiments with prominent machine learning frameworks and state-of-the-art solvers for combinatorial problems. We show that our methods provide insight into the relationship between hyperparameter settings and performance, and demonstrate that-even in very high- dimensional cases-most performance variation is attributable to just a few hyperparameters.},

Overall, 28.4{\%} of passengers reported feelings of illness, 12.8{\%} reported nausea and 1.7{\%} reported vomiting during coach travel. Passenger nausea and illness ratings increased with increased exposure to lateral coach motion at low frequencies ({\textless} 0.5 Hz). Motion in other axes correlated less well with sickness, although there were some intercorrelations between the motions in the different axes. Sickness levels among passengers were greater with drivers who drove to produce higher average magnitudes of fore-and-aft and lateral vehicle motion. Nausea occurrence was greater on routes classified as being predominantly cross-country where magnitudes of lateral vehicle motion were significantly higher. Lateral motion and motion sickness increased from the front to the rear of each vehicle. No significant differences in sickness were found between the five different vehicle types used in the study. The applicability of a motion sickness dose model to these data is discussed.},

Despite widespread research on self-driving, user acceptance remains an essential part of successful market penetration; this forms the motivation behind studies on human factors associated with autonomous shuttle services. We address this by providing a comfortable driving experience while not compromising safety. We focus on the accelerations and jerks of vehicles to reduce the risk of motion sickness and to improve the driving experience for passengers. Furthermore, this study proposes a time-optimal velocity planning method for guaranteeing comfort criteria when an explicit reference path is given. The overall controller and planning method were verified using real-time, software-in-the-loop (SIL) environments for a real-time vehicle dynamics simulation; the performance was then compared with a typical planning approach. The proposed optimized planning shows a relatively better performance and enables a comfortable passenger experience in a self-driving shuttle bus according to the recommended criteria.},

abstract = {Inverse optimal control, also known as inverse reinforcement learning, is the problem of recovering an unknown reward function in a Markov decision process from expert demonstrations of the optimal policy. We introduce a probabilistic inverse optimal control algorithm that scales gracefully with task dimensionality, and is suitable for large, continuous domains where even computing a full policy is impractical. By using a local approximation of the reward function, our method can also drop the assumption that the demonstrations are globally optimal, requiring only local optimality. This allows it to learn from examples that are unsuitable for prior methods. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).},

abstract = {Path planning and control of autonomous vehicles in dynamic environments can be a challenging problem, as a result of complex vehicle dynamics and constraints, as well as the existence of moving obstacles. Typical trajectory planners involve a high level decision making approach, using graph searches and a prior knowledge of the environment. Other approaches, attempt to use Potential Field (PF) functions as a basis for describing a goal within the environment, applied primarily to the field of robotics. This thesis aims to develop a method for path planning using online lane detection data from sensors. A Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework is proposed to fulfill this task. The path planner uses a simple dynamic model in combination with PF functions in order to create a feasible trajectory though the environment. To ensure safety around obstacles, vehicles and other actors are modeled as a potential field. A fast MPC controller is developed for path following. The two MPCs are then integrated in a hierarchical control structure. The method has been simulated in different scenarios and validated using a 15 degrees of freedom car model},

abstract = {This paper studies data-driven short-term load forecasting, where historic data are used to predict the expected load for the next 24 h. Our focus is to simplify and automate the estimation and analysis of various forecasting models. We propose a three-stage approach to load forecasting, consisting of preprocessing, forecasting, and postprocessing, where the forecasting stage uses evolution to automatically set the parameters for each model. In our implementation, the preprocessing stage includes removal of daily and weekly seasonality by a nonparametric method. This seasonal pattern is added in the postprocessing stage. The system allows for easy exploration of several forecasting models, without the need to have in-depth knowledge of how to obtain the best performance for each model. We apply the method to several forecasting algorithms and on three datasets: 1) distribution substation; 2) GEFCom 2012; and 3) a transmission level dataset. We find that the forecasting algorithms considered produce significantly more accurate forecasts when combined with our proposed preprocessing stage compared with applying the same algorithms directly on the raw data. We also find that the parameter values chosen by evolution often provide insights into the interplay between the different datasets and forecast models. Software is available online.},

For restricted input length, some continuous functions on real-valued sequences need a number of neurons increasing at least linearly in the input length. On unary sequences, any mapping with bounded range can be approximated in the maximum norm.

Our approach provides a well-defined, globally normalized distribution over decision sequences, while providing the same performance guarantees as existing methods. We develop our technique in the context of modeling real- world navigation and driving behaviors where collected data is inherently noisy and imperfect.

In this paper, we present an approach to learn the composite navigation behavior of interacting agents from demonstrations. The decision process that ultimately leads to the observed continuous trajectories of the agents often also comprises discrete decisions, which partition the space of composite trajectories into homotopy classes. Therefore, our method uses a mixture probability distribution that consists of a discrete distribution over the homotopy classes and continuous distributions over the composite trajectories for each homotopy class. Our approach learns the model parameters of this distribution that match, in expectation, the observed behavior in terms of user-defined features. To compute the feature expectations over the high-dimensional continuous distributions, we use Hamiltonian Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We exploit that the distributions are highly structured due to physical constraints and guide the sampling process to regions of high probability. We apply our approach to learning the behavior of pedestrians and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

We think of the expert as trying to maximize a reward function that is expressible as a linear combination of known features, and give an algorithm for learning the task demonstrated by the expert. Our. algorithm is based on using "inverse reinforcement learning" to try to recover the unknown reward function.

abstract = {Electric energy forecasting domain attracts researchers due to its key role in saving energy resources, where mainstream existing models are based on Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). These models encounter high-level of non-linearity between input data and output predictions and limited adoptability in real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, energy forecasting domain demands more robustness, higher prediction accuracy and generalization ability for real-world implementation. In this paper, we achieve the mentioned tasks by developing a hybrid sequential learning-based energy forecasting model that employs Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) into a unified framework for accurate energy consumption prediction. The proposed framework has two major phases: (1) data refinement and (2) training, where the data refinement phase applies preprocessing strategies over raw data. In the training phase, CNN features are extracted from input dataset and fed in to GRU, that is selected as optimal and observed to have enhanced sequence learning abilities after extensive experiments. The proposed model is an effective alternative to the previous hybrid models in terms of computational complexity as well prediction accuracy, due to the representative features' extraction potentials of CNNs and effectual gated structure of multi-layered GRU. The experimental evaluation over existing energy forecasting datasets reveal the better performance of our method in terms of preciseness and efficiency. The proposed method achieved the smallest error rate on Appliances Energy Prediction (AEP) and Individual Household Electric Power Consumption (IHEPC) datasets, when compared to other baseline models.},

In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: Speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful functional ANalysis Of VAriance framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ≈15 years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components.

For user acceptance, such vehicles should not only be safe and reliable, they should also provide a comfortable user experience. However, individual perception of comfort may vary considerably among users. Whereas some users might prefer sporty driving with high accelerations, others might prefer a more relaxed style. Typically, a large number of parameters such as acceleration profiles, distances to other cars, speed during lane changes, etc., characterize a human driver's style. Manual tuning of these parameters may be a tedious and error-prone task. Therefore, we propose a learning from demonstration approach that allows the user to simply demonstrate the desired style by driving the car manually. We model the individual style in terms of a cost function and use feature-based inverse reinforcement learning to find the model parameters that fit the observed style best. Once the model has been learned, it can be used to efficiently compute trajectories for the vehicle in autonomous mode. We show that our approach is capable of learning cost functions and reproducing different driving styles using data from real drivers.},
