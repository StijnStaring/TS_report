abstract = {The rapid increase in human population and development in technology have sharply raised power consumption in today's world. Since electricity is consumed simultaneously as it is generated at the power plant, it is important to accurately predict the energy consumption in advance for stable power supply. In this paper, we propose a CNN-LSTM neural network that can extract spatial and temporal features to effectively predict the housing energy consumption. Experiments have shown that the CNN-LSTM neural network, which combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), can extract complex features of energy consumption. The CNN layer can extract the features between several variables affecting energy consumption, and the LSTM layer is appropriate for modeling temporal information of irregular trends in time series components. The proposed CNN-LSTM method achieves almost perfect prediction performance for electric energy consumption that was previously difficult to predict. Also, it records the smallest value of root mean square error compared to the conventional forecasting methods for the dataset on individual household power consumption. The empirical analysis of the variables confirms what affects to forecast the power consumption most.},

@article{Shi2018,
abstract = {The key challenge for household load forecasting lies in the high volatility and uncertainty of load profiles. Traditional methods tend to avoid such uncertainty by load aggregation (to offset uncertainties), customer classification (to cluster uncertainties) and spectral analysis (to filter out uncertainties). This paper, for the first time, aims to directly learn the uncertainty by applying a new breed of machine learning algorithms-deep learning. However, simply adding layers in neural networks will cap the forecasting performance due to the occurrence of over-fitting. A novel pooling-based deep recurrent neural network is proposed in this paper which batches a group of customers' load profiles into a pool of inputs. Essentially the model could address the over-fitting issue by increasing data diversity and volume. This paper reports the first attempts to develop a bespoke deep learning application for household load forecasting and achieved preliminary success. The developed method is implemented on Tensorflow deep learning platform and tested on 920 smart metered customers from Ireland. Compared with the state-of-The-Art techniques in household load forecasting, the proposed method outperforms ARIMA by 19.5{\%}, SVR by 13.1{\%} and classical deep RNN by 6.5{\%} in terms of RMSE.},

@article{Hoverstad2015,
abstract = {This paper studies data-driven short-term load forecasting, where historic data are used to predict the expected load for the next 24 h. Our focus is to simplify and automate the estimation and analysis of various forecasting models. We propose a three-stage approach to load forecasting, consisting of preprocessing, forecasting, and postprocessing, where the forecasting stage uses evolution to automatically set the parameters for each model. In our implementation, the preprocessing stage includes removal of daily and weekly seasonality by a nonparametric method. This seasonal pattern is added in the postprocessing stage. The system allows for easy exploration of several forecasting models, without the need to have in-depth knowledge of how to obtain the best performance for each model. We apply the method to several forecasting algorithms and on three datasets: 1) distribution substation; 2) GEFCom 2012; and 3) a transmission level dataset. We find that the forecasting algorithms considered produce significantly more accurate forecasts when combined with our proposed preprocessing stage compared with applying the same algorithms directly on the raw data. We also find that the parameter values chosen by evolution often provide insights into the interplay between the different datasets and forecast models. Software is available online.},

@article{NarjesFallah2018,
abstract = {Energy management systems are designed to monitor, optimize, and control the smart grid energy market. Demand-side management, considered as an essential part of the energy management system, can enable utility market operators to make better management decisions for energy trading between consumers and the operator. In this system, a priori knowledge about the energy load pattern can help reshape the load and cut the energy demand curve, thus allowing a better management and distribution of the energy in smart grid energy systems. Designing a computationally intelligent load forecasting (ILF) system is often a primary goal of energy demand management. This study explores the state of the art of computationally intelligent (i.e., machine learning) methods that are applied in load forecasting in terms of their classification and evaluation for sustainable operation of the overall energy management system. More than 50 research papers related to the subject identified in existing literature are classified into two categories: namely the single and the hybrid computational intelligence (CI)-based load forecasting technique. The advantages and disadvantages of each individual techniques also discussed to encapsulate them into the perspective into the energy management research. The identified methods have been further investigated by a qualitative analysis based on the accuracy of the prediction, which confirms the dominance of hybrid forecasting methods, which are often applied as metaheurstic algorithms considering the different optimization techniques over single model approaches. Based on extensive surveys, the review paper predicts a continuous future expansion of such literature on different CI approaches and their optimizations with both heuristic and metaheuristic methods used for energy load forecasting and their potential utilization in real-time smart energy management grids to address future challenges in energy demand management.},

@article{Kong2019,
abstract = {As the power system is facing a transition toward a more intelligent, flexible, and interactive system with higher penetration of renewable energy generation, load forecasting, especially short-term load forecasting for individual electric customers plays an increasingly essential role in the future grid planning and operation. Other than aggregated residential load in a large scale, forecasting an electric load of a single energy user is fairly challenging due to the high volatility and uncertainty involved. In this paper, we propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network-based framework, which is the latest and one of the most popular techniques of deep learning, to tackle this tricky issue. The proposed framework is tested on a publicly available set of real residential smart meter data, of which the performance is comprehensively compared to various benchmarks including the state-of-the-arts in the field of load forecasting. As a result, the proposed LSTM approach outperforms the other listed rival algorithms in the task of short-term load forecasting for individual residential households.},
