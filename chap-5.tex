\section{The First Topic of this Chapter}
\subsection{Item 1}
\subsubsection{Sub-item 1}

Run the best model each time 20 times and report the difference of  performance on the validationset by making use of a boxplot. 


Say that here use the models that obtained in the previous chapter. Make MSE plot for the different NN and the baseline models for each serie and make a comparison of the MAPE with the other baseline model. (by making use of barplots --> normalized with the worst performer) Performance on the test set. 

Make a plot of the day forecast for each NN model --> four graphs bundled. 

- for stateless random 10 percent is used as validation set. Remember that should shuffle the training set beforehand otherwise just the last 9 percent of the data is used. this is around 9 days
- for stateful --> the last 30 days of November will be used --> no shuffling is allowed.
