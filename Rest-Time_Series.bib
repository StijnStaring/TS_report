abstract = {As the power system is facing a transition toward a more intelligent, flexible, and interactive system with higher penetration of renewable energy generation, load forecasting, especially short-term load forecasting for individual electric customers plays an increasingly essential role in the future grid planning and operation. Other than aggregated residential load in a large scale, forecasting an electric load of a single energy user is fairly challenging due to the high volatility and uncertainty involved. In this paper, we propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network-based framework, which is the latest and one of the most popular techniques of deep learning, to tackle this tricky issue. The proposed framework is tested on a publicly available set of real residential smart meter data, of which the performance is comprehensively compared to various benchmarks including the state-of-the-arts in the field of load forecasting. As a result, the proposed LSTM approach outperforms the other listed rival algorithms in the task of short-term load forecasting for individual residential households.},

abstract = {The rapid increase in human population and development in technology have sharply raised power consumption in today's world. Since electricity is consumed simultaneously as it is generated at the power plant, it is important to accurately predict the energy consumption in advance for stable power supply. In this paper, we propose a CNN-LSTM neural network that can extract spatial and temporal features to effectively predict the housing energy consumption. Experiments have shown that the CNN-LSTM neural network, which combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), can extract complex features of energy consumption. The CNN layer can extract the features between several variables affecting energy consumption, and the LSTM layer is appropriate for modeling temporal information of irregular trends in time series components. The proposed CNN-LSTM method achieves almost perfect prediction performance for electric energy consumption that was previously difficult to predict. Also, it records the smallest value of root mean square error compared to the conventional forecasting methods for the dataset on individual household power consumption. The empirical analysis of the variables confirms what affects to forecast the power consumption most.},

@article{Shi2018,
abstract = {The key challenge for household load forecasting lies in the high volatility and uncertainty of load profiles. Traditional methods tend to avoid such uncertainty by load aggregation (to offset uncertainties), customer classification (to cluster uncertainties) and spectral analysis (to filter out uncertainties). This paper, for the first time, aims to directly learn the uncertainty by applying a new breed of machine learning algorithms-deep learning. However, simply adding layers in neural networks will cap the forecasting performance due to the occurrence of over-fitting. A novel pooling-based deep recurrent neural network is proposed in this paper which batches a group of customers' load profiles into a pool of inputs. Essentially the model could address the over-fitting issue by increasing data diversity and volume. This paper reports the first attempts to develop a bespoke deep learning application for household load forecasting and achieved preliminary success. The developed method is implemented on Tensorflow deep learning platform and tested on 920 smart metered customers from Ireland. Compared with the state-of-The-Art techniques in household load forecasting, the proposed method outperforms ARIMA by 19.5{\%}, SVR by 13.1{\%} and classical deep RNN by 6.5{\%} in terms of RMSE.},

abstract = {The performance of many machine learning methods depends critically on hyperparameter settings. Sophisticated Bayesian optimization methods have recently achieved considerable successes in optimizing these hyperparameters, in several cases surpassing the performance of human experts. However, blind reliance on such methods can leave end users without insight into the relative importance of different hyperparameters and their interactions. This paper describes efficient methods that can be used to gain such insight, leveraging random forest models fit on the data already gathered by Bayesian optimization. We first introduce a novel, linear-time algorithm for computing marginals of random forest predictions and then show how to leverage these predictions within a functional ANOVA framework, to quantify the importance of both single hyperparameters and of interactions between hyperparameters. We conducted experiments with prominent machine learning frameworks and state-of-the-art solvers for combinatorial problems. We show that our methods provide insight into the relationship between hyperparameter settings and performance, and demonstrate that-even in very high- dimensional cases-most performance variation is attributable to just a few hyperparameters.},

@article{Hoverstad2015,
abstract = {This paper studies data-driven short-term load forecasting, where historic data are used to predict the expected load for the next 24 h. Our focus is to simplify and automate the estimation and analysis of various forecasting models. We propose a three-stage approach to load forecasting, consisting of preprocessing, forecasting, and postprocessing, where the forecasting stage uses evolution to automatically set the parameters for each model. In our implementation, the preprocessing stage includes removal of daily and weekly seasonality by a nonparametric method. This seasonal pattern is added in the postprocessing stage. The system allows for easy exploration of several forecasting models, without the need to have in-depth knowledge of how to obtain the best performance for each model. We apply the method to several forecasting algorithms and on three datasets: 1) distribution substation; 2) GEFCom 2012; and 3) a transmission level dataset. We find that the forecasting algorithms considered produce significantly more accurate forecasts when combined with our proposed preprocessing stage compared with applying the same algorithms directly on the raw data. We also find that the parameter values chosen by evolution often provide insights into the interplay between the different datasets and forecast models. Software is available online.},

Any measurable function can be approximated in probability. Additionally, bounds on the resources sufficient for an approximation can be derived in interesting cases. On the contrary, there exist computable mappings on symbolic data which cannot be approximated in the maximum norm. For restricted input length, some continuous functions on real-valued sequences need a number of neurons increasing at least linearly in the input length. On unary sequences, any mapping with bounded range can be approximated in the maximum norm. Consequently, standard sigmoidal networks can compute any mapping on offline inputs as a computational model. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Electric energy forecasting domain attracts researchers due to its key role in saving energy resources, where mainstream existing models are based on Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). These models encounter high-level of non-linearity between input data and output predictions and limited adoptability in real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, energy forecasting domain demands more robustness, higher prediction accuracy and generalization ability for real-world implementation. In this paper, we achieve the mentioned tasks by developing a hybrid sequential learning-based energy forecasting model that employs Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) into a unified framework for accurate energy consumption prediction. The proposed framework has two major phases: (1) data refinement and (2) training, where the data refinement phase applies preprocessing strategies over raw data. In the training phase, CNN features are extracted from input dataset and fed in to GRU, that is selected as optimal and observed to have enhanced sequence learning abilities after extensive experiments. The proposed model is an effective alternative to the previous hybrid models in terms of computational complexity as well prediction accuracy, due to the representative features' extraction potentials of CNNs and effectual gated structure of multi-layered GRU. The experimental evaluation over existing energy forecasting datasets reveal the better performance of our method in terms of preciseness and efficiency. The proposed method achieved the smallest error rate on Appliances Energy Prediction (AEP) and Individual Household Electric Power Consumption (IHEPC) datasets, when compared to other baseline models.},

abstract = {Several variants of the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for recurrent neural networks have been proposed since its inception in 1995. In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: Speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful functional ANalysis Of VAriance framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ≈15 years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.},
