abstract = {At LEP, b quarks are produced in Z decays with a large longitudinal polarization. A possible strategy for detecting some polarization effect through the study of the leptonic energy spectrum in the inclusive semi-leptonic decay of b hadrons is studied in detail. We especially focus on the large theoretical uncertainties due to the ambiguities on the b-fragmentation function. The related uncertainties in the lepton spectrum, which could fake polarization effects, can be controlled, by making use of both LEP data and lower-energy PETRA data on b production. A first comparison with experimental results is shown as well. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {The performance of many machine learning methods depends critically on hyperparameter settings. Sophisticated Bayesian optimization methods have recently achieved considerable successes in optimizing these hyperparameters, in several cases surpassing the performance of human experts. However, blind reliance on such methods can leave end users without insight into the relative importance of different hyperparameters and their interactions. This paper describes efficient methods that can be used to gain such insight, leveraging random forest models fit on the data already gathered by Bayesian optimization. We first introduce a novel, linear-time algorithm for computing marginals of random forest predictions and then show how to leverage these predictions within a functional ANOVA framework, to quantify the importance of both single hyperparameters and of interactions between hyperparameters. We conducted experiments with prominent machine learning frameworks and state-of-the-art solvers for combinatorial problems. We show that our methods provide insight into the relationship between hyperparameter settings and performance, and demonstrate that-even in very high- dimensional cases-most performance variation is attributable to just a few hyperparameters.},

Any measurable function can be approximated in probability. Additionally, bounds on the resources sufficient for an approximation can be derived in interesting cases. On the contrary, there exist computable mappings on symbolic data which cannot be approximated in the maximum norm. For restricted input length, some continuous functions on real-valued sequences need a number of neurons increasing at least linearly in the input length. On unary sequences, any mapping with bounded range can be approximated in the maximum norm. Consequently, standard sigmoidal networks can compute any mapping on offline inputs as a computational model. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Energy management systems are designed to monitor, optimize, and control the smart grid energy market. Demand-side management, considered as an essential part of the energy management system, can enable utility market operators to make better management decisions for energy trading between consumers and the operator. In this system, a priori knowledge about the energy load pattern can help reshape the load and cut the energy demand curve, thus allowing a better management and distribution of the energy in smart grid energy systems. Designing a computationally intelligent load forecasting (ILF) system is often a primary goal of energy demand management. This study explores the state of the art of computationally intelligent (i.e., machine learning) methods that are applied in load forecasting in terms of their classification and evaluation for sustainable operation of the overall energy management system. More than 50 research papers related to the subject identified in existing literature are classified into two categories: namely the single and the hybrid computational intelligence (CI)-based load forecasting technique. The advantages and disadvantages of each individual techniques also discussed to encapsulate them into the perspective into the energy management research. The identified methods have been further investigated by a qualitative analysis based on the accuracy of the prediction, which confirms the dominance of hybrid forecasting methods, which are often applied as metaheurstic algorithms considering the different optimization techniques over single model approaches. Based on extensive surveys, the review paper predicts a continuous future expansion of such literature on different CI approaches and their optimizations with both heuristic and metaheuristic methods used for energy load forecasting and their potential utilization in real-time smart energy management grids to address future challenges in energy demand management.},

abstract = {This paper studies data-driven short-term load forecasting, where historic data are used to predict the expected load for the next 24 h. Our focus is to simplify and automate the estimation and analysis of various forecasting models. We propose a three-stage approach to load forecasting, consisting of preprocessing, forecasting, and postprocessing, where the forecasting stage uses evolution to automatically set the parameters for each model. In our implementation, the preprocessing stage includes removal of daily and weekly seasonality by a nonparametric method. This seasonal pattern is added in the postprocessing stage. The system allows for easy exploration of several forecasting models, without the need to have in-depth knowledge of how to obtain the best performance for each model. We apply the method to several forecasting algorithms and on three datasets: 1) distribution substation; 2) GEFCom 2012; and 3) a transmission level dataset. We find that the forecasting algorithms considered produce significantly more accurate forecasts when combined with our proposed preprocessing stage compared with applying the same algorithms directly on the raw data. We also find that the parameter values chosen by evolution often provide insights into the interplay between the different datasets and forecast models. Software is available online.},

abstract = {Electric energy forecasting domain attracts researchers due to its key role in saving energy resources, where mainstream existing models are based on Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). These models encounter high-level of non-linearity between input data and output predictions and limited adoptability in real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, energy forecasting domain demands more robustness, higher prediction accuracy and generalization ability for real-world implementation. In this paper, we achieve the mentioned tasks by developing a hybrid sequential learning-based energy forecasting model that employs Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) into a unified framework for accurate energy consumption prediction. The proposed framework has two major phases: (1) data refinement and (2) training, where the data refinement phase applies preprocessing strategies over raw data. In the training phase, CNN features are extracted from input dataset and fed in to GRU, that is selected as optimal and observed to have enhanced sequence learning abilities after extensive experiments. The proposed model is an effective alternative to the previous hybrid models in terms of computational complexity as well prediction accuracy, due to the representative features' extraction potentials of CNNs and effectual gated structure of multi-layered GRU. The experimental evaluation over existing energy forecasting datasets reveal the better performance of our method in terms of preciseness and efficiency. The proposed method achieved the smallest error rate on Appliances Energy Prediction (AEP) and Individual Household Electric Power Consumption (IHEPC) datasets, when compared to other baseline models.},

abstract = {The key challenge for household load forecasting lies in the high volatility and uncertainty of load profiles. Traditional methods tend to avoid such uncertainty by load aggregation (to offset uncertainties), customer classification (to cluster uncertainties) and spectral analysis (to filter out uncertainties). This paper, for the first time, aims to directly learn the uncertainty by applying a new breed of machine learning algorithms-deep learning. However, simply adding layers in neural networks will cap the forecasting performance due to the occurrence of over-fitting. A novel pooling-based deep recurrent neural network is proposed in this paper which batches a group of customers' load profiles into a pool of inputs. Essentially the model could address the over-fitting issue by increasing data diversity and volume. This paper reports the first attempts to develop a bespoke deep learning application for household load forecasting and achieved preliminary success. The developed method is implemented on Tensorflow deep learning platform and tested on 920 smart metered customers from Ireland. Compared with the state-of-The-Art techniques in household load forecasting, the proposed method outperforms ARIMA by 19.5{\%}, SVR by 13.1{\%} and classical deep RNN by 6.5{\%} in terms of RMSE.},

abstract = {The rapid increase in human population and development in technology have sharply raised power consumption in today's world. Since electricity is consumed simultaneously as it is generated at the power plant, it is important to accurately predict the energy consumption in advance for stable power supply. In this paper, we propose a CNN-LSTM neural network that can extract spatial and temporal features to effectively predict the housing energy consumption. Experiments have shown that the CNN-LSTM neural network, which combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), can extract complex features of energy consumption. The CNN layer can extract the features between several variables affecting energy consumption, and the LSTM layer is appropriate for modeling temporal information of irregular trends in time series components. The proposed CNN-LSTM method achieves almost perfect prediction performance for electric energy consumption that was previously difficult to predict. Also, it records the smallest value of root mean square error compared to the conventional forecasting methods for the dataset on individual household power consumption. The empirical analysis of the variables confirms what affects to forecast the power consumption most.},

In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: Speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful functional ANalysis Of VAriance framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ≈15 years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.},
