@article{Ahmed2010,
abstract = {This paper develops a new crossover operator, Sequential Constructive crossover (SCX), for a genetic algorithm that generates high quality solutions to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The sequential constructive crossover operator constructs an offspring from a pair of parents using better edges on the basis of their values that may be present in the parents' structure maintaining the sequence of nodes in the parent chromosomes. The efficiency of the SCX is compared as against some existing crossover operators; namely, edge recombination crossover (ERX) and generalized N-point crossover (GNX) for some benchmark TSPLIB instances. Experimental results show that the new crossover operator is better than the ERX and GNX.},
